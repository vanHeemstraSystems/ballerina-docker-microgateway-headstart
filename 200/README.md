# 200 - Developing the service with Ballerina and Microgateway

We already have the project 'bookService' created, but if starting from fresh use the following command to create a new ballerina ***project*** (here: ```bookService```):

```
$ bal new bookService
```

```
[this repository]
  README.md
  bookService
    .git
    .gitignore (auto-created)
    Ballerina.toml (auto-created)
    modules
      http
        HTTPService.bal
```

To also create our first module 'http', if starting from fresh use the following Ballerina command for creating a new ***module*** (here: http):

```
$ cd bookService
$ bal module http
```

The service project will have a very simple structure. It will be composed of the root folder, bookService, and the module with our source code, http. 

In order to ***initialize*** the project, we will have to execute the following command from the main folder.

```
$ cd bookService
$ bal init
```

Our service will be called ***HTTPService.bal*** and will look as follows (note: EP = EndPoint):

```
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/log;
import ballerinax/docker;

@docker:Expose {}
listener http:Listener bookEP = new(9091);
map<json> booksMap = {};

@docker:Config {
  Registry:"com.chakray.example", name:"example", tag:"v1.0"
}

@http:ServiceConfig {
  basePath: "/bookService"
}

service books on bookEP {
  @http:ResourceConfig {
    methods: ["GET"], path: "/book/{bookId}"
  }

  resource function getById(http:Caller caller, http:Request req, string bookId) {
    json? payload = booksMap[bookId];
    http:Response response = new;
    if (payload == null) {
      response.statusCode = 404;
      payload = "Item Not Found";
    }
    response.setJsonPayload(untaint payload);
    var result = caller->respond(response);
    if (result is error) {
      log:printError("Error sending response", err = result);
    }
  }@http:ResourceConfig {
    methods: ["POST"], path: "/book"
  }

  resource function addBook(http:Caller caller, http:Request req) {
    http:Response response = new;
    var bookReq = req.getJsonPayload();
    if (bookReq is json) {
      string bookId = bookReq.book.id.toString();
      booksMap[bookId] = bookReq;
      response.statusCode = 201;
      response.setHeader("Location", "http://localhost:9091/bookService/book/" + bookId);
    } else {
      response.statusCode = 400;
      response.setPayload("Invalid payload received");
    }
    var result = caller->respond(response);
    if (result is error) {
      log:printError("Error sending response", err = result);
    }
  }
}
```
[root]/bookService/modules/http/HTTPService.bal

We import the Ballerina utility libraries: docker, http and log. Using this code as a reference, letâ€™s focus on the key parts of this service:

- We configure our service to listen to the requests arriving at port 9091 within the context of the /bookService URL.

- We link two resources to the service: one that listens for the GET method which expects an identifier in the URL, and another one that listens for the POST method, which expects a JSON object as a message.

- The GET method will return response code 200 and the object associated with the identifier posted in the URL, or 404 if the object is not found.

- The POST method will store the JSON object in a map in the internal memory and respond 201 and a header containing the URL of our service if we want to retrieve the stored book.
